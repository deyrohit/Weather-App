The androidx.appcompat.widget.SearchView is part of the AndroidX library, which is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library. 
Here are a few reasons why you might want to use androidx.appcompat.widget.SearchView over android.support.v7.widget.SearchView:

Backward Compatibility: AndroidX libraries provide backward compatibility, meaning they work across different versions of the Android platform. This is particularly useful if you want your app to support 
a wide range of Android versions.

Frequent Updates: The AndroidX libraries receive more frequent updates than the original support libraries.This means you can benefit from the latest bug fixes and improvements more quickly.

Tint Aware: AndroidX components are “tint aware”, meaning they can be customized with different colors and styles. This can help you achieve a consistent look and feel across your app.

Future-Proof: Google has stopped development on the android.support.* packages and is only updating the AndroidX libraries. This means that if we continue to use the android.support.v7.widget.SearchView, 
we won’t benefit from any new features or improvements made in future updates.
