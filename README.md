# Weather-App

Build an Android App to display current weather of any city using Kotlin and XML.

User can access essential information such as maximum and minimum temperatures, humidity levels , wind speed and many other parameters.

To enhance the user experience, I integrated the Lottie Library for smooth animations. These animations provide visual appeal and make the app engaging.

To enhance the user experience, I integrated the different images to show different weather condition.

The app fetches weather data from a trusted API using Retrofit and the GSON Converter. This ensures that users receive reliable and up-to-date information.
